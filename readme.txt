NOTE TO USERS:

I built this using a Linux system.
Thus, files are referenced in the Linux format.
I'm not sure if this will work for Windows.
May fix later.

EXPLANATION OF USE:
On startup, you will be asked for parameters:

* Resource Folder: The folder you will keep resources will be stored in.
This must be initialized to contain a sub-folder entitled 'Tilesets'.
In here, you will store your tilesets to be used for map building.

* Number of columns: How many columns the input tileset contains

* Number of rows: How many rows the input tileset contains

* Output Width: How many columns wide your output map will be

* Output height: How many rows tall your output map will be

* Name of input tileset: Name of input tileset stored in folder 'Tilesets'

SHORTCUTS:

* Ctrl + S is to save
